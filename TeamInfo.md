## Project Summary

College Ranker aims to improve the college decision-making process of parents and highschoolers by integrating traditional ranking systems with user-generated insights. By aggregating rankings from major sources like US News, THE, and QS, we create a more balanced and transparent average ranking system tailored for domestic students. Users can filter rankings based on various criteria and set personal school preferences. Upon enrolling in a school, they can share their experiences through reviews, which are displayed anonymously on a News Feed page for prospective students. To enhance usability, we incorporate a generative AI workflow that leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to synthesize objective school data and user opinions into concise summaries on school detail pages. This unique combination of structured rankings and community-driven insights provides a comprehensive and intuitive platform for college selection.
